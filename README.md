Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS)

 internet activist Eli Pariser 
 
Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering (also known as the personality-based approach),[7] as well as other systems such as knowledge-based systems. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.[8] Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.[9] Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system.
Reproducibility crisis
has shown that on average less than 40% of articles are reproducible, with as little as 14% in some conferences. Overall the study identifies 18 articles, only 7 of them could be reproduced and 6 of them could be outperformed by much older and simpler properly tuned baselines
